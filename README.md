# 2D-Systolic-Array-Multiplier

This repository implements a synthesizable two dimensional systolic array that can be configured to multiply 2 square matrices of any dimension.

The `rtl` sub-directory contains the RTL written in System Verilog and the `tb` sub-directory contains the test bench written in C++ and simulated using Verilator.
